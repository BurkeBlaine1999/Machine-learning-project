# Machine learning project

This project uses machine learning to analyze a health insurance data set using linear regression, decision trees and kNN.

* Using linear regression, the model can predict the costs of a persons health insurance charges.
* Using Decision trees, the model can predict if a person is a smoker or not.
* Using kNN, the model can predict if a person is a smoker or not.

Please see the [project report](https://github.com/BurkeBlaine1999/Machine-learning-project/blob/main/doc/Report.pdf) for more information on the analysis.

This project uses machine learning to analyze a health insurance data set using linear regression, decision trees and kNN.


* Using linear regression, the model can predict the costs of a persons health insurance charges.
* Using Decision trees, the model can predict if a person is a smoker or not.
* Using kNN, the model can predict if a person is a smoker or not.
